      <h3>Ahmed Dadabhai</h3>
      <p> I am a beginner programmer and I haven't had any past experience in programming before starting university.
        Throughout my childhood, playing video games was something I really enjoyed doing. This really enticed me into 
        choosing Computer Science and motivated to try programming for the first time.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Planets</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates an understanding 
	of the use of loops, variables and images etc. I created a sketch about planets. 
        In the sketch, when the position of the mouse hovers over each planet, 
        information about the planet displays on the screen. I aligned the planets and adjusted 
        the sizes whilst also using if loops to determine what pieces of information should be the 
        output for a particular mouse position.

      <h3>2022: Java Project</h3>
      <p> As part of my second programming project, I used Java to create a game based on head football, a popular game I used 
          to play when I was younger. The project was also heavily inspired by my keen interest in the sport of football. Hence why 
          I created a multiplayer game in which the goal is to score more against your opponent and therefore win the game.
          This was a good chance to incorporate the fundamentals of a game such as collisions, pickups and sounds.
